- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael.  People call me Moose.
- 👀 I’m interested in game dev, cloud dev, scripting, anything code related and solving software engineering problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust, go and how to incorporate modern languages into my work and play.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever catches my fancy
- 📫 You can email me at mmasterson@msquaredsoftwaresolutions.com
- My website (https://msquaredsoftwaresolutions.com) is one of my many pet projects.  I've built it myself using Angular 18 and Typescript. I've also made use of AWS technologies such as S3, CloudFront, Route53, SES, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline.  I am in the process of adding a serverless backend using APIGateway and Lambda.  The lambdas will likely be written in Go or Rust.
